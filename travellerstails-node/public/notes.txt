Database
========

mongodb with monk middleware
	db = monk('localhost:27017/taglet'),

users
	{'user': user}

collections - presently hardcoded into index.js
	{'collection': collection, 'name': name, 'sources': [sourceDropboxPath*]},

resources
	{'fileID': fileID, 'filename': filename, 'path': path, 'collectionID': collectionID, 'name': nameIfKnown, 'tags': [tag*], 'meta': unalteredMetadataDictionaryOrNull, 'dropboxMeta': dropoxFileMetadataDictionary}

	where..
	
	fileID is id string eg NON690
		(currently expected to be filename without extension) - keeping this separate from db id as might not be unique between collections
	filename - eg NON690.png
	path - path (forward-slash style) eg GRANT/standardised-images/ relative to content root (Travellers\ Tails/CONTENT at present)
		(path can be used to group like resources)
	collectionID - one of ['cook', 'grant', 'horniman', 'hunterian', 'nmm']
	tags - array of strings (empty array if not tagged yet)
	name - presentation name/mini-description if available (make fileID if name unavailable?)

tags
	{'tag': tagText, 'taggings' [[collection, fileID, user]*]}

The resources collection & the tags collection are two ways of storing pretty-much the same stuff (ie not normalised)
The exception is that tags that are not attached to any images are only listed in the tags collection

Could break resources into individual mongodb collections - cook, grant, .. if no common tagging or cross-talk wanted?

Site
====

/ - links to collection pages and to a page showing all tags
/signin
/tags - list of all tags, with the items that they tag listed for each one
/collection/<collectionID> - list of resources in a single collection showing their tags
/tagger/<collectionID>/<fileID> - the main page for viewing & adding tags
/tag/<tagText> - page showing all images associated with this tag
/image/<sizeCode>/<collectionID>/<fileID>

In /tagger/...
Add a tag by typing into add box and pressing return
Pick a tag by clicking on it in the pick list (it reduces if you start typing a prefix into the add box)
Remove a tag by clicking on it in the tags list

<sizeCode> is xs, s, m, l, or xl (as dropbox) - all others eg 'full' imply full size image

Unlinked pages:

/unused - to become means to delete unused tags?
/notes.txt - this file
/robots.txt

/parseGrant - to read soda file grant.data and insert into resources & tags
/scan/<collectionID> - to insert resources based on reading source folders
